Guess Country by Shape

## Local GeoJSON Data

The game uses a local `countries.geojson` file to draw country shapes. If you
wish to replace or update the shapes, place a valid GeoJSON file named
`countries.geojson` in the project directory. The application loads this file
once when it first starts and reuses it for subsequent rounds.
